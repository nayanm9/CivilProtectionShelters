# Civil Protection Shelters
**Civil Protection Shelters** is an effort to protect the citizens from natural disasters.<br>It uses the principles of emergency operations: 
- Prevention
- Mitigation
- Preparation
- Response or Emergency Evacuation
- Recovery

Disaster Management Authorities can notify people living in area of concern by sending alert from WebApp which will send SMS and emails to people regsitered to our site.

As people get direct notifications from disaster management authorities, they will have sufficient time to get to the safe place to which the location would be provided in the SMS and Email they receive. This makes the evacuation efficient, faster and more reliable, internet resulting in saving many lives. Prevention is always better than cure.

On alert, we provide nearby shelter locations to people so that they are safe before and during the impact.<br>
